# Item-Frequency-Analyzer

The Item Frequency Analyzer was created with C++. 

The client, Corner Grocer, required a system for analyzing the frequency of items purchased from their produce section on a daily basis. Users are prompted to enter information regarding which item they are searching for the frequency of. From there, the system will return a numeric value for the frequency of said item. Users may also print a list of items with their frequency or they may print a histogram of the items and their frequency.
